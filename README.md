# Introduction

Tried to learn some go. This repo houses excercies that I've done or
am doing.

Most of these are basic examples from the`A tour of Go` tutorial
series. Some that stand out to me are:

* `finder.go`: Simple and dumb program that takes a string and an
  optional path and recursively searches files with name containing
  the given string.
